Casey Foundation, released this month, evaluates states on four metrics of child well-being. Those are: health, economic well-being, education and family &amp; community.<\/p>\n<p>For overall child well-being, Missouri ranks near the middle: 28th of 50 states, with 50 being the worst. Other Midwestern states, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin, were in the top ten of all states for child well-being.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing down the state\u2019s overall ranking was one factor in particular: children\u2019s health.<\/p>\n<p>Only 15 states in the country had a lower rating for children\u2019s health.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur health rankings are part of the problem,\u201d said Tracy Greever-Rice, program director of Missouri KIDS COUNT.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have work to do here in Missouri around infant mortality,\u201d Greever-Rice said. \u201cAnd we also have work to do, like many states with large rural populations, in terms of teen and adolescent deaths.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Only 10 other states had the same or worse rates of child and teen deaths as Missouri, one of the factors included in the health measure.<\/p>\n<p>The rate of child and teen deaths was 39 per 100,000 in Missouri in 2021 \u2014 up from 32 per 100,000 just two years earlier. The state\u2019s trend mirrored the national trend, which increased from 25 deaths per 100,000 to 30 deaths per 100,000 from 2019 to 2021<\/p>\n<p>Greever-Rice said several factors could have contributed to the state\u2019s relatively high rate of child and teen deaths in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cParticularly at risk \u2014 and a change that we\u2019ve seen over the past few years \u2014 are adolescent boys in more rural areas,\u201d Greever-Rice said, \u201cand of course, Missouri, like everywhere else has been impacted by the opioid and fentanyl epidemic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo we just have some high risk populations here that we have work to do around.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Suicide rates among young people have increased nationally over the last several decades, particularly in rural areas, where mental health services can be scarcer, research has found.<\/p>\n<p>Firearms became the leading cause of kids\u2019 deaths in the United States in 2020, surpassing car accidents. According to Children\u2019s Defense Fund, Missouri was one of ten states that accounted for half of all child and teen gun deaths in the nation from 2011-2020. Bills to limit access to guns failed in the legislature this session.<\/p>\n<p>Other indicators of children\u2019s health \u2014 the rates of low birth-weight babies, children without health insurance, and children who are overweight or obese \u2014 were all slightly worse in Missouri than on average, according to the report.<\/p>\n<p>The best states for children\u2019s health, according to the report, include Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire, while the worst are Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.<\/p>\n<p>Missouri children fared best, out of the four broad indicators of well-being, on the measure of economic well-being. The state ranked 18th of 50 on economic well-being.<\/p>\n<p>While 3 in 10 children nationally live in households with a high housing cost burden, only around 2 in 10 Missouri children do, per the report.<\/p>\n<p>The rate of kids whose parents lack secure employment is also slightly better in Missouri at 26% than nationally, 29%.<\/p>\n<p>The rate of children in poverty roughly mirrors the national average \u2014 16% in Missouri and 17% nationally. The rate of teens not in school and not working is 7% in Missouri, equal to the national average.<\/p>\n<p>The Kids Count index also included data on the cost of child care nationally, though it did not factor into the overall well-being rating.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor many, many families right now,\u201d Greever-Rice said, \u201cthe cost [of child care] continues to go up and availability just decreases, particularly in rural areas and underserved areas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Missouri, a single parent with a toddler attending a child care center would pay 28% of the median income on child care, according to the Kids Count report. Dozens of interviews conducted by The Independent and Muckrock indicated that that burden can be untenable for many families \u2014 even though it is actually a lower burden than in much of the rest of the country, per the report.<\/p>\n<p>As the Missouri Independent and Muckrock\u2019s investigative collaboration, Disappearing Daycare, found, the child care crisis is one not just of cost but access: Missourians struggle to find child care openings, particularly for infants, and the situation is even worse for those seeking government assistance.<\/p>\n<p>The average cost for a toddler\u2019s care at a center in Missouri was nearly $9,000, according to KIDS COUNT.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Missouri ranks in the bottom third of all states for children\u2019s health, according to a recent report using data from 2021.
