The drop rate also has been particularly high in other states. For people whose cases were decided in May, around half or more got dropped in Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.<\/p>\n<p>By its own count, Arkansas has dropped more than 140,000 people from Medicaid.<\/p>\n<p>The eligibility redeterminations have created headaches for Jennifer Mojica, 28, who was told in April that she no longer qualified for Medicaid because Arkansas had incorrectly determined her income was above the limit.<\/p>\n<p>She got that resolved, but was then told her 5-year-old son was being dropped from Medicaid because she had requested his cancellation \u2014 something that never happened, she said. Her son\u2019s coverage has been restored, but now Mojica says she\u2019s been told her husband no longer qualifies. The uncertainty has been frustrating, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Arkansas officials said they have tried to renew coverage automatically for as many people as possible and placed a special emphasis on reaching families with children. But a 2021 state law requires the post-pandemic eligibility redeterminations to be completed in six months, and the state will continue \u201cto swiftly disenroll individuals who are no longer eligible,\u201d the Department of Human Services said in statement.<\/p>\n<p>Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has dismissed criticism of the state\u2019s process.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThose who do not qualify for Medicaid are taking resources from those who need them,\u201d Sanders said on Twitter last month. \u201cBut the pandemic is over \u2014 and we are leading the way back to normalcy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>More than 93 million people nationwide were enrolled in Medicaid as of the most recent available data in February \u2014 up nearly one-third from the pre-pandemic total in January 2020. The rolls swelled because federal law prohibited states from removing people from Medicaid during the health emergency in exchange for providing states with increased funding.<\/p>\n<p>Now that eligibility reviews have resumed, states have begun plowing through a backlog of cases to determine whether people\u2019s income or life circumstances have changed. States have a year to complete the process. But tracking down responses from everyone has proved difficult, because some people have moved, changed contact information or disregarded mailings about the renewal process.<\/p>\n<p>Advocates fear that many households losing coverage may include children who are actually still eligible, because Medicaid covers children at higher income levels than their parents or guardians. A report last year by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services forecast that children would be disproportionately impacted, with more than half of those disenrolled still actually eligible.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s difficult to confirm, however, because the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services doesn\u2019t require states to report a demographic breakdown of those dropped.<\/p>\n<p>Medicaid recipients in numerous states have described the eligibility redetermination process as frustrating.<\/p>\n<p>Julie Talamo, of Port Richey, Florida, said she called state officials every day for weeks, spending hours on hold, when she was trying to ensure her 19-year-old special-needs son, Thomas, was going to stay on Medicaid.<\/p>\n<p>She knew her own coverage would end but was shocked to hear Thomas\u2019 coverage would be whittled down to a different program that could force her family to pay $2,000 per month. Eventually, an activist put Talamo in contact with a senior state health care official who confirmed her son would stay on Medicaid.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis system was designed to fail people,\u201d Talamo said of the haphazard process.<\/p>\n<p>In Indiana, Samantha Richards, 35, said she has been on Medicaid her whole life and currently works two part-time jobs as a custodian. Richards recalled receiving a letter earlier this year indicating that the pandemic-era Medicaid protection was ending. She said a local advocacy group helped her navigate the renewal process. But she remains uneasy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMedicaid can be a little unpredictable,\u201d Richards said. \u201cThere is still that concern that just out of nowhere, I will either get a letter saying that we have to reapply because we missed some paperwork, or I missed a deadline, or I\u2019m going to show up at the doctor\u2019s office or the pharmacy and they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Your insurance didn\u2019t go through.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More than 1 million people have been dropped from Medicaid in the past couple of months as some states moved swiftly to halt health care coverage following the end of the coronavirus pandemic.
